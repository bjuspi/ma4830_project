# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master develop]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - name: Build development docker image
      run: cd dockerfiles && docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml build
    
    # Push development docker image
    - name: Push development docker image
      run: docker push leonardoedgar/realtime:master-latest
  
  unit_tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: leonardoedgar/realtime:master-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Generate makefiles
        run: mkdir build && cd built && cmake ..
      - name: Generate executables
        run: cd build && make all
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: cd build/tests && ./run_unit_tests
